A project for our Intro to Data Science course. This is a project I did with a groupmate. 
In this project we were tasked to gather and clean data, provide exploratory data analysis, model the data, 
and finally evaluate/interpret the results we got. 
For our project we decided to use a dataset about Netflix
movies and TV shows that we retrieved from Kaggle. It contains more than 7000 rows of different movies and TV shows and
listing each of their description, genres, title, and directors.
